# High-level Overview

### Building a decentralized datalake

KYVE is an initiative to store any data stream, with built-in validation. By leveraging the Arweave blockchain, we can permanently and immutably store this data.

### A decentralized and user-verified solution

Blockchain technology came along and provided a solution to centralization problems by offering a decentralized and user-verified solution. With this exciting new technology comes underlying issues such as the storage and accessibility of the rapidly growing amount of data. At full capacity, Solana is expected to produce the equivalent of 4 Petabytes of data/year.

### A decentralized archival framework

Due to its scalability, immutability, and availability, Arweave is the go-to solution for data storage. Nonetheless, data availability does not equal data validity. Therefore, we see KYVE and Arweave as complementary: while KYVE provides reliable data validity, Arweave, in contrast, focuses on data availability (replicability).

### Lifetime data

Data are stored onto Arweave, a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments.

### Reliable data

When a blockchain produces a block, this information is public; KYVE retrieves this data via nodes of the blockchain.

### Verified data

KYVE validators and delegators are receiving rewards for participating in the network and contributing to verifying data.
